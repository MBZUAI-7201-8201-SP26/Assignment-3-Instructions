# Assignment-3-Instructions

Instructions for Assignment 3

This document explains:
- how to accept the assignment,
- what you need to complete for Assignment 3, and
- how the cross-validation (peer check) works for Assignment 3.

Please read it carefully before starting!

## Part 1: Do the Lab

1. (Similar to Assignments 1 and 2) Accept the assignment via the GitHub Classroom link: https://classroom.github.com/a/kwKBECvP .

2. Read the [Lab 3 instructions](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-metal/blob/main/docs/source/tt-metalium/tt_metal/labs/matmul/lab3/lab3.rst).

3. Complete the exercises by following the instructions in the lab document.

4. Save evidence that your code runs correctly, such as terminal outputs, logs, screenshots, profiling outputs, and the required plots/figures where applicable.

5. You will need to submit your source codes for the following exercises particularly:
   - **Exercise 2:** Extending the Standalone Multicast Example
   - **Exercise 3:** Batched Multicast for Improved Throughput
   - **Exercise 4:** Multi Core Matrix Multiplication with Multicast
6. Required deliverables:
   - A `README.md` with build/run commands for each exercise you implemented
   - Evidence artifacts (results, correctness check with the reference implementation, performance comparisons as required) committed to the repo.

## Part 2: Cross-Validation (Peer Review)

You will be randomly assigned with another classmate (details will be announced later).

For cross-validation, you will:

1. Grant access to the classmate you are assigned to (as instructed in class).
2. Follow your assigned classmate’s `README.md` and try to reproduce their results for Assignment 3.
3. Check whether their outputs match what they claim.
4. Save evidence of your cross validation attempts (terminal output, screenshots, notes, profiler outputs).
5. Open an issue on your assigned classmate's repo with your evidence and findings
6. Use the Assignment 3 checklist below in your opened issue and feel free to add comments/questions.
7. You can also reply to the issue opened by your assigned classmate in your own repo.
